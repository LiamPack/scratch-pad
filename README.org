* A Scratch Pad

After becoming disappointed with some of semi-dead projects I have lying around on github, I
figured a conceptually clean option would to have a public "scratch pad." This repo
contains will probably contain some work semi-complete, some work complete, and by
majority most work incomplete or conceptual at best.

Not sure if this is much better than just having a couple of inactive projects lying
around, but it feels slightly less embarrassing.
