* A Scratch Pad

After becoming disappointed with some of semi-dead projects I have lying around on github, I
figured a conceptually clean option would to have a public "scratch pad." This repo will
contain some complete work, some partially-complete work, and, by-and-large, incomplete work
or ideas.

Not sure if this is much better than having a couple of inactive projects lying around, but
it feels slightly less embarrassing.
